You currently have **microphone mode** enabled. The server warned:

```
⚠️ WARNING: No system audio capture device found!
   This will capture MICROPHONE audio instead of system audio.
```

1. Right-click speaker icon → "Sound settings"
2. Scroll down → "Sound Control Panel"
3. "Recording" tab
4. Right-click empty space → "Show Disabled Devices"
5. If you see "Stereo Mix":
   - Right-click it → "Enable"  
   - Right-click again → "Set as Default Device"
   - Click OK
   - ✅ DONE! Run `python server.py` again

**If "Stereo Mix" doesn't appear:**

**Option B: VB-CABLE (5 minutes)**
1. Download: https://vb-audio.com/Cable/
2. Extract ZIP
3. Right-click `VBCABLE_Setup_x64.exe` → "Run as administrator"
4. Click "Install Driver"
5. **Restart your computer** (required!)
6. After restart:
   - Sound settings → Output: "CABLE Input"
   - Sound settings → Input: "CABLE Output"
7. ✅ DONE! Run `python server.py`

**Want to hear on laptop speakers too?**
